## Timer App

![timer-app-ui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2496324/156528197-60616806-426a-4825-8b90-58112b862bb7.png)

Tiny Timer App created using Godot (I know.. it's a game engine but who cares as long as we learn something)

Well, I partially take back what I said above, now I know why making a timer using a game engine is a stupid idea.. the build file is HUGE!! (32Mb)! Anyhow, that was fun.

Inspired from @michaelvillar's [Timer-app project](https://github.com/michaelvillar/timer-app) I also shamelessly stole the [alarm-sound](https://github.com/michaelvillar/timer-app/blob/master/Timer/alert-sound.caf) from his project.
