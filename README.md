## Timer App

Tiny Timer App created using Godot (I know.. it's a game engine but who cares as long as we learn something)

Inspired from @michaelvillar's [Timer-app project](https://github.com/michaelvillar/timer-app) I also shamelessly stole the [alarm-sound](https://github.com/michaelvillar/timer-app/blob/master/Timer/alert-sound.caf) from his project.
